# psfclj

PSF parser for JVM written in clojure.

## Building

Requires [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/index.html) to run, see
their docs for more information.

### Build and Install as MAVEN dependency for Java InterOp

```bash
$ lein pom && lein install
```

### Build JAR/UBERJAR

```bash
$ lein jar
$ lein uberjar
```

### Build Standalone Executable

Simply run `make` and the `Makefile` will take care of it.
The executable will be `./target/psfconvert`.

## Usage

After building with lein you can run:

```bash
$ java -jar psfclj-0.1.0-standalone.jar [options] <psf-file>
```

The standalone executable can be run like so:

```bash
$ psfconvert [options] <psf-file>
```

Depending on the option, this will produce output to `STDOUT`.
This can be redirected to a file, or processed further with something
like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) 
or [gron](https://github.com/TomNomNom/gron).
If no `<psf-file>` is specified, it will try to read from `STDIN`.

### Options

- `-g <grammar>` Specify path to alternative `<grammar>`.
- `-j` JSON output (default).
- `-c` CSV output (values only).
- `-h` or `--help` for a short help.

## PSF BNF

The default grammar can be found in `resources/psf.bnf`:

```bnf
<psf> = <section> *

<section> = HEADER <attribute> *
          | TYPE   <attribute> *
          | SWEEP  <attribute> *
          | TRACE  <attribute> *
          | VALUE  <attribute> *
          | END

<attribute> = <key> [<unit>] <values> [<prop>]
            | <key> <types> <prop>
            | <key> <struct> [<prop>]

<key> = " * "

<unit> = " * "

values = <value>
       | ( <value> * )

<value> = #'\S+'
        | " * "

<types> = <type>
        | <type> *

<type> = FLOAT
       | DOUBLE
       | COMPLEX

<prop> = PROP( <attribute> * )

<struct> = STRUCT( <attribute> * )
```

## Java API Reference

After installing with 

```bash
$ lein pom && lein install
``` 

the `psfclj*.jar` should be in your local repository and classpath.

```java
// Somehow read contents of PSF

import psfclj.PSFParser.*;

parser = new Parser();
parser.parse(<file content>)
```

## TODO
