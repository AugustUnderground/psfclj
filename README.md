## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

```bash
    $ java -jar psfclj-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
```

## Options

```bash
psfclj [options] <file>
```
Where `[options]` are:

- `-g <grammar>` Specify path to alternative `<grammar>`.
- `-j` JSON output (default).
- `-c` CSV output (values only).

and `<file>` is a PSF.

## Examples

...

## PSF BNF

The default grammar can be found in `resources/psf.bnf`:

```bnf
<psf> = <section> *

<section> = HEADER <attribute> *
          | TYPE   <attribute> *
          | SWEEP  <attribute> *
          | TRACE  <attribute> *
          | VALUE  <attribute> *
          | END

<attribute> = <key> [<unit>] <values> [<prop>]
            | <key> <types> <prop>
            | <key> <struct> [<prop>]
<key> = " * "
<unit> = " * "
values = <value>
       | ( <value> * )
<value> = #'\S+'
        | " * "
<types> = <type>
        | <type> *
<type> = FLOAT
       | DOUBLE
       | COMPLEX
<prop> = PROP( <attribute> * )
<struct> = STRUCT( <attribute> * )
```

### Bugs

- [ ] Can't read PSF with `<unit>` in `VALUE` section.
